# Complete Parameter Reference

Every single parameter in the entire pipeline is described here. If you need to tweak every little detail of how your samples are analyzed, you've come to the right place! Note that *every* parameter is described here, even those that shouldn't be used, so proceed with caution!

## Input/output options

Define where the pipeline should find input data and save output data.

| Parameter | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| `input` | Path the folder containing input reads. <details><summary>Help</summary><small>For Illumina (paired-end) reads, the file names must be identical until the ending underscore with a read number, e.g. 'sample1_S10_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz' and 'sample1_S10_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz'. The read number must be designated using either '_1' and '_2' or '_R1' and '_R2'. For Nanopore reads, each fastq file is assumed to be a unique sample, so, e.g. 'FAP01234_pass_barcode05_abcd01234_0.fastq.gz' and 'FAP01234_pass_barcode05_abcd01234_1.fastq.gz' are assumed to be different samples even though they are from the same barcode. All read files must be gzipped, and have the extension '.fastq.gz' or '.fq.gz'.</small></details>| `string` | . |  |
| `platform` | NGS platform used to sequence the samples | `string` |  |  |
| `paired` | Flag to indicate whether the reads files are paired-end or not | `boolean` |  |  |
